        <p style= "font-family:sans-serif"> What: Open and Distance Learning (ODL) is an approach to teaching and learning that offers open and flexible access to learning opportunities to anyone, anywhere, and at any time.

            Why: ODL is especially useful for potential students who are unable to access learning opportunities where they are provided. For these students, learning opportunities need to be offered where they are located, and provided at a time which best suits them and their circumstances. ODL also offers students choices in relation to entry and exit points, as well as selection of courses, making it particularity suitable for lifelong-long learners who wish to continue with their education while in employment or engaged with domestic work. </p>
